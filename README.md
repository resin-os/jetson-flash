# jetson-flash

> This tool allows users to flash ResinOS on Jetson supported devices

This tool is separate into two parts:
- Extract resin-image from a resin-image-flasher (this will be moved to [etcher](https://github.com/resin-io/etcher) once the fatfs issues are fixed)
- Flash resin-image via USB on a Jetson board (this will be moved to [etcher](https://github.com/resin-io/etcher))
